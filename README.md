# Hedera JavaScript SDK

Hedera JavaScript API is the environment for working with Hedera Hashgraph - a distributed network using the hashgraph consensus algorithm for fast, fair and secure transactions. This is an unofficial version of the development tool.

Currently, this tool only works on macOS, as well as intermittently. The release version will be available for general use in the Production branch.
